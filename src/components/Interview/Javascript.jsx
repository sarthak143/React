              <p>
                HTML defines a set of events, and JavaScript uses event handlers
                to manage these events. React also implements event handlers,
                such as onClick, onMouseMove, onLoad, onError, etc. React’s
                event handlers are named with camelCase APIs, while JavaScript
                event handlers are named with lowercase APIs.
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to work as a cross-browser application, React has
                created a wrapper same as the native browser in order to avoid
                creating multiple implementations for multiple methods for
                multiple browsers, creating common names for all events across
                browsers. Another benefit is that it increases the performance
                of the application as React reuses the event object.

                Event delegation allows us to avoid adding multiple event
                listeners to multiple child nodes; instead, the event listener
                is added to one parent. That event listener analyzes bubbled
                events to find a match on child elements.

                we can identify specific elements by using the .nodeName
                property.
