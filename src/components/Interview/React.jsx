                React donot update Dom tree directly, It creates an in-memory
                replica of dom known as virtual tree. Whenever there is a update
                to a node, React creates a second virtual dom with updated node
                and subtree. Then it do a diff between previous and current
                virtual dom to identify what are exact changes. After
                identifying exact change it then update only that change in
                original dom using batch update. This changes from virtual dom
                to Dom are done through Batch update. React accumulates various
                changes to various nodes through diffing between two virtual
                doms. And these changes are applied to DOM using batch update
              </p>
