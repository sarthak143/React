                React keeps in-memory virtual dom in sync with actual dom using

              <p>
                React donot update Dom tree directly, It creates an in-memory
                replica of dom known as virtual tree. Whenever there is a update
                to a node, React creates a second virtual dom with updated node
                and subtree. Then it do a diff between previous and current
                virtual dom to identify what are exact changes. After
                identifying exact change it then update only that change in
                original dom using batch update. This changes from virtual dom
                to Dom are done through Batch update. React accumulates various
                changes to various nodes through diffing between two virtual
                doms. And these changes are applied to DOM using batch update
              </p>

                  <h5 className="text-primary">ACTION</h5>
                  Actions are JavaScript object that contains information.
                  Actions are the only source of information for the store. It
                  basically carries a payload of information from the
                  application to the store. It only tells us what has happened.
                  Actions have a type property that they must include as type
                  property tells what kind of action to perform. Action can also
                  contain the payload(data field in the action) to describe the
                  action.

                  <h5 className="text-primary">REDUCER</h5>
                  It Determines How The State Will Change. Reducers Read The
                  Payloads From The Actions And Then Updates The Store Via The
                  State Accordingly. It Is A Pure Function Which Returns A New
                  State From The Initial State. It Returns The Previous State As
                  It Is If No Work Needs To Be Done.

                  <h5 className="text-primary">Middleware</h5>
                  With a plain basic Redux store, you can only do simple
                  synchronous updates by dispatching an action. Middleware
                  extends the store's abilities, and lets you write async logic
                  that interacts with the store. Middleware only wraps the
                  store's dispatch function. Technically, anything a middleware
                  can do, you can do manually by wrapping every dispatch call,
                  but it's easier to manage this in a single place and define
                  action transformations on the scale of the whole project.

                  <h5 className="text-primary">Thunk</h5>
                  is used to delay the evaluation/calculation of an operation
                  allows you to write action creators that return a function
                  instead of an action. The thunk can be used to delay the
                  dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain
                  condition is met. The inner function receives the store
                  methods dispatch() and getState() as parameters.

                  Redux DevTools is a live-editing time travel environment for
                  Redux with hot reloading, action replay, and customizable UI.
                  If you don't want to bother with installing Redux DevTools and
                  integrating it into your project, consider using Redux
                  DevTools Extension for Chrome and Firefox.

                  It is a store enhancer to add multiple middlewares to Redux.
                  you can add redux-thunk and logger passing them as arguments

                  make sure to put applyMiddleware before them in the
                  composition chain because the middleware is potentially
                  asynchronous.

                A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React
                for reusing component logic.in other words, a higher-order
                component is a function that takes a component and returns a new
                component.

                The fireEvent method allows you to fire events to simulate user
                actions. fireEvent dispatches exactly the events you tell it to
                and just those - even if those exact events never had been
                dispatched in a real interaction in a browser. <br />
